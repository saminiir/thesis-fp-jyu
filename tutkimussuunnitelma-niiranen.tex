\chapter{Background of the research}

Recently, the Reactive Manifesto~\parencite{reactive2013} was created and signed by over four thousand enthusiasts. The main driving theme of the manifesto are the requirements of complex and large-scale application domains, ranging from ``mobile devices to cloud-based clusters running thousands of multicore processors''~\parencite{reactive2013}. Functional reactive programming aims to deliver event-driven and resilient application stacks for computing environments where concurrency and scalability are central.~\parencite{reactive2013}

Applications implemented with the FRP-paradigm are said to provide elegant solutions 

Not only in heavy server-side computing, but FRP is also increasingly utilized in ``smaller'' application domains such as RESTful services and mobile applications. The driving force behind FRP is to increase the abstraction level of programming, enabling developers to concentrate on the objectives rather than the implementation.

Functional reactive programming adds to the original 

Functional reactive programming has grown in popularity for all software application dimensions. 

Research questions:
    -What is functional reactive programming and its advantages and challenges?
    -How is code quality (volume, redundancy, unit size, complexity, coupling) measured with FRP?
    -How is FRP implemented in imperative-style programming languages?
    -Are there practicalities when implementing applications in with FRP?
        -Is there a threat of ``time-space'' memory-leaks ?
        -How are FRP-style code bases tested?

Agile development methods such as Scrum~\parencite{schwaber2002agile} and XP~\parencite{beck2004extreme} have been shown to have a positive impact on process and product quality through increased success rate of projects~\parencite{dingsoyr2012decade}. Teams and teamwork are in a central role in agile software development~\parencite{fowler2001agile}. The teams are expected to be highly skilled, communicative and cooperative, but also self-organizing and
autonomous~\parencite{chow2008survey}. Agile team members are given more
control over their projects compared to traditional software development. In the same time, rather than reviewing the productivity of a team member, the collective performance of the team is measured. 

Self-organization is a consequence of the complexity of software projects, while it helps to adapt to approaching deadlines by tailoring the tasks as needed~\parencite{schwaber2000selforg}. Leadership is not completely absent in self-organizing agile teams~\parencite{cockburn2001agile}, but manifests itself in a form where emphasis is put on communication and collaboration between team members. 

\section{Main concepts}

Functional programming is a software language paradigm, where functions are first-class citizens and ``pure''. State, as often manifesting as variables in imperative languages, is avoided and captured into concepts such as~\textit{monads}.

Functional reactive programming adds to the functional paradigm by shifting the focus on time-varying behaviors and stream sequences of events~\parencite{wan2000functional}. Essentially,
%{{{
\begin{comment}
The key ideas in FRP are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are time-ordered sequences of discrete-time event occurrences.
\end{comment}
%}}}

\section{Motivation}

\section{Previous work}

\chapter{Research problem and methods}
The aim of the study is to present the FRP paradigm, its main concepts and how it is efficiently utilized. Challenges of the paradigm are analyzed.
\section{Limitations}
The subject of teams and teamwork is a vast, multi-disciplinary research topic. This study will be limited to agile methods utilized in software development. Furthermore, the behaviour of individual team members and their collaboration is examined strictly from the viewpoint of agile software projects.
\section{Research problem}
The research can be decomposed into four questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the characteristics and guidelines of a self-organizing team?
    \item How is the performance of agile teams perceived and measured?
    \item What kind of impact self-organization is seen to have on performance?
    \item What kind of experiences from working in self-organized teams in actual projects have been gained?
\end{itemize}

The research problem can be expressed as follows: \textit{How does self-organization affect team performance in agile software development?}
\section{Research methods}
The thesis utilizes literature review as its main research method. The review consists of an overview into teams in general (team categories, processes of teamwork, team structures, etc.) and factors affecting self-organization and team performance.

In the second part, the research themes are investigated through empirical research. This consists of conducting a survey or a set of interviews in a software company and analyzing the results. For this purpose, a conceptual research model is constructed based on the literature review.
\section{Expected results and their significance}
The results aim at explaining the nature of self-organization and effectiveness in agile teams. The expected results are that self-organization improves the performance of an agile team and that self-organization is actively being promoted in prominent software consultant companies. The results will consist of practical knowledge of how to promote team self-organization to achieve greater team effectiveness.

The study will contribute to the ongoing research on agile methods and team performance. For example, team leaders and members of agile projects will benefit from reading the study and applying the principles in their work. The study also aims to be a notable source for academic research in the future regarding agile software projects.
